  <h1>Privacy Policy for CarePathHF — AHA/ACC Daily Self-Check Assistant</h1>
  <p><em>Effective date: September 27, 2025</em></p>

  <p>CarePathHF is a digital health coaching tool designed to help patients follow 
  American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline-based 
  daily self-checks for heart failure. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily check-in responses (e.g., breathing, swelling, fatigue, medication/salt intake)</li>
    <li>Device-derived vitals when connected (weight, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, steps; optional glucose)</li>
    <li>Metadata such as timestamps and device/source identifiers</li>
    <li>Minimal technical data for service operation (e.g., request logs, error logs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide AHA/ACC-guided daily self-checks and supportive coaching</li>
    <li>Generate weekly summaries and red-flag alerts for the user</li>
    <li>Create shareable caregiver/clinician reports when the user requests it</li>
    <li>Improve reliability and safety (e.g., troubleshooting, preventing abuse)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. What We Do Not Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
    <li>We do not share data with third parties for advertising.</li>
    <li>We do not make diagnoses or treatment decisions.</li>
    <li>We do not change medications or provide emergency medical advice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sources & Integrations</h2>
  <p>CarePathHF may connect—at the user’s choice—to consumer devices or health platforms such as cellular/Bluetooth scales, 
  blood pressure cuffs, wearables (e.g., Apple Watch), Apple Health/Google Fit, or vendor clouds (e.g., Fitbit, Garmin). 
  When connected, device data is retrieved via secure HTTPS. Users can disconnect integrations at any time.</p>

  <h2>5. Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>If no external integration is used, data remains within the user’s ChatGPT session context. 
  If a separate Health Data Broker/API is connected, that system stores minimal necessary data to power features. 
  We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes outlined or as required by law. Users may request deletion.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use encryption in transit (HTTPS) and access controls such as API keys for integrated services. 
  No security measure is perfect; users should avoid sharing sensitive data they do not wish to store.</p>

  <h2>7. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We share reports only when the user explicitly requests them to be sent to a caregiver or clinician. 
  Reports include data sources and timestamps for transparency. We do not otherwise disclose personal data except 
  as required by law or to protect rights and safety.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the service without connecting devices (manual entry only)</li>
    <li>Connect/disconnect integrations at any time</li>
    <li>Request a copy or deletion of data stored by the Health Data Broker/API (if used)</li>
    <li>Adjust ChatGPT Data Controls to limit how conversations are used by OpenAI</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>CarePathHF is a guideline-based self-check and coaching tool. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, 
  diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions 
  you may have regarding a medical condition. If you think you may be experiencing an emergency, call your local emergency number.</p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>CarePathHF is intended for adults or for use under the guidance of a clinician or caregiver. 
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate consent.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to features, integrations, or legal requirements. 
  We will indicate the effective date at the top and, when feasible, provide notice of material changes.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions or requests about privacy can be sent to: <a href="mailto:rishikeshv@gmail.com">rishikeshv@gmail.com</a></p>
